# AAA PM — about

Solo PO + Dev workflow: **`docs/pm/`** + **Jira**. Ticket shapes: pack **`PROPOSAL.md`** (`{pack-root}/PROPOSAL.md`).

## Pack root

`{pack-root}/templates/` — see `templates/references/paths.md`.

## Source of truth

| Artifact | Role |
|----------|------|
| `docs/pm/project-brief/OVERVIEW.md` | Product — goal, features, scope |
| `docs/pm/jira/OVERVIEW.md` | Board index — tables + sync note |
| `docs/pm/jira/epics/E-NN-*.md` | One epic — body = Jira Epic description |
| `docs/pm/jira/stories/S-NN-*.md` | One story — AC, Handoff QA, DoD |
| `docs/pm/jira/tasks/{todo,inprogress,done}/` | One task per file |
| `docs/qa/ACCESS.md` | Staging, login, seed (once per project) |
| `docs/pm/intake/raw-intake/` | Verbatim feedback |
| `docs/pm/plan/CHANGELOG.md` | Plan / push events |
| **Jira** | Execution status — `/aaa-pm-sync` moves task files |

Gate: `brief_status: complete` on project brief (`/aaa-pm-setup`).

**Rule:** local markdown = Jira description (no shortened paste block).

## Skills

| Skill | When |
| --- | --- |
| `/aaa-pm-about` | This help |
| `/aaa-pm-setup` | Scaffold `docs/pm/` + `docs/qa/ACCESS.md` |
| `/aaa-pm-plan` | Epic + story files + tasks |
| `/aaa-pm-push` | Create Jira from files |
| `/aaa-pm-intake` | Stakeholder feedback |
| `/aaa-pm-sync` | Jira → task folders + OVERVIEW |
| `/aaa-pm-task-doing` | Issue URL/key → dev context |

## Flows

**New project:** `setup` → fill brief → `plan` → `push`

**Daily (Dev):** `task-doing` + implementation skill

**PO:** `intake` · `plan` + `push` · `sync` on a schedule · QA per PROPOSAL (Handoff → AC → DoD)

**Board changed in Jira:** `sync`

## Plan shape

| Level | Where |
|-------|--------|
| **Epic** | `jira/epics/E-NN-*.md` + row on OVERVIEW |
| **Story** | `jira/stories/S-NN-*.md` + row on OVERVIEW (active epic only) |
| **Task** | `jira/tasks/todo/` etc. |

Rules: `templates/references/epic-status.md`, `templates/references/jira-task-file.md`

Examples (pack-only): `templates/examples/`

PO skill cheat sheet: **`PROPOSAL.md`** § Bonus — PO workflow using AI skills.
